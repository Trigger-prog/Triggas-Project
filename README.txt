Wazzup, to whoever is reading this. (HI SIR AARON!!!)

So, I decided just to go solo, since I know I would have a hard time doing it my groupmates.

The time I heard sir said we can go solo, I was so dang happy.

Anyway this is my Digital Notebook for GENERAL MATHEMATICS:

This is a school project for my Math subject in the end of 1st Quarter.
The task is to create a webpage containing math notes, using HTML and CSS.
The goal is to present different math topics in an easy-to-navigate and visually organized way.

🗂️ File Structure

index.html → Homepage

Relations.html → Topic page for Relations

Functions.html → Topic page for Functions

funcandgrpahs.html → Topic page for Functions and their Graphs

Evaluation of functions.html → Topic page for Evaluating functions

GraphAnal.html  → Topic page for Graph Analysis

style.css → Main stylesheet for all pages

images/ → Folder containing topic images and background

🎨 Features

Organized navigation (links to each topic page)

Consistent color scheme (2–3 colors)

Background image on homepage

Topic pages include images and explanations

"Back to Homepage" button on every topic page

Responsive design using margins, padding, and spacing
