    <p>Now, what is a function?
<strong>A function</strong> is a type of relation or a rule of correspondence between two 
nonempty sets such that, to each element of the first set called <strong>domain</strong>, 
there corresponds one and only one element of the second set called 
<strong>range</strong>. <br>
<b>REMARKS</b>:
A function is said to be a ‚Äúwell-behaved‚Äù relation. Why? This is because 
given a starting point, we know exactly where to go. Given a value, say x, 
we get only and exactly one value of y. <br>
This means that while <strong>all functions are relations</strong> (since they pair 
information), <strong>not all relations are functions</strong>. In fact, <strong>functions are a 
sub-classification of relations</strong>.</p>

        <p>Given a relation of x and y, we say ‚Äúy is a <strong>function</strong> of x‚Äù if for every element x in the domain, 
there corresponds exactly one element <strong>y</strong> in the range.
<br>
<br>
With that, only <strong>figures a and c are functions. Figure b is not a function.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>For a mapping diagram, each value of x can only correspond to only one value of y.</strong>

        <p>‚Ä¢ the rule which assigns to each person his aunt/s<br>
‚ÜíThis is NOT A FUNCTION since a person can have more than one aunts.<br>
‚Ä¢ the rule which assigns to each car to its plate number
‚ÜíThis is a FUNCTION since a car can only have one plate number.<br>
‚Ä¢ the rule which assigns each student to his/her moderator<br>
‚Üí This is a FUNCTION since many students can be assigned to a one 
moderator.</p>

      	<h2>SET OF ORDERED PAIRS: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
        <p>{ (SUPERMAN, DC), (BATMAN, DC), (THE FLASH, DC),
(SPIDERMAN, MARVEL), (CAPTAIN AMERICA, MARVEL),
(WOLVERINE, MARVEL) } <br>
This set of ordered pairs is a <strong>FUNCTION.</strong>
<br>
<br>
For a set of ordered pairs to be a FUNCTION, there should be <strong>NO 
REPETITION OF THE X-COORDINATE.</strong>

      	<h2>GRAPH: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
      	<p>If we are given a graph, how do we know if it‚Äôs a function or not?</p>
        <img src="Images\Screenshot 2025-08-19 224354.png" alt="idk bru">
        <p>It is used to visually determine if a graph represents a function. Just slide any 
vertical line (think of your pencil) across the graph to see if any two or more 
points of the graph lie on the same vertical line.
<br>
If there are <strong>no</strong> two or more points on the same vertical line, then the relation is a 
<strong>FUNCTION.</strong>
<br>
If there <strong>are</strong> two or more points on the same vertical line then the relation is <strong>NOT 
A FUNCTION.</strong></p>
<br>

      	<h2>EQUATION: FUNCTION OR NOT?</h2>
        <p>It is relatively easy to determine whether an equation is a function by 
solving for y. When you are given an equation and a specific value of x, 
there should only be one corresponding y-value for that x-value. For 
example, <br>
ùë¶ = ùë• + 1<br>
is a FUNCTION because y will always be one greater than x. <br>
ùë¶ = ùë•¬≤ ‚àí 1<br>
is also a FUNCTION; although x-values of 1 and -1 give the same y-value 
(0), which is the only possible y-value for each of those x-values.</p>
<h3>EQUATION: FUNCTION OR NOT?(cont.)</h3>
      <p>However,<br>
ùë¶¬≤ = ùë• + 5<br>
is NOT A FUNCTION. If you assume that x=4, then
ùë¶¬≤ = 4 + 5
ùë¶ = 9<br>
and this has two possible y-values: -3 and 3. Recall that for each x-value, 
there should only be one and exactly one y-value for the equation to be a 
function.<b></p>
